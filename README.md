# Progressive Depletion Minting (PDM)
## Reference Implementation – Personal Edition

Author: Valraj Singh Mann  
Framework: Mann Mechanics  
Status: Reference / Demonstration Implementation  

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

## Overview

This repository contains a **Reference Implementation** of  
**Progressive Depletion Minting (PDM) – Personal Edition**.

Progressive Depletion Minting (PDM) is a system control mechanism
designed to regulate issuance, scarcity, and tolerance as a system
scales, with the objective of long-term stability and sustainability.

This implementation exists to **demonstrate observable mechanism
behaviour**, not to serve as a production system.

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

## Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to:

• Provide a canonical reference model of PDM behaviour  
• Enable education, research, and independent evaluation  
• Move discussion from theory to observable dynamics  
• Serve as a non-commercial Personal Edition implementation  

This repository allows users to **observe how the mechanism responds
to inputs over time**, under controlled and transparent conditions.

## What This Is

This repository **IS**:

• A reference implementation  
• A demonstration engine  
• A learning and research artefact  
• A non-commercial Personal Edition of PDM  
• A behavioural simulator of mechanism dynamics  

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

## What This Is NOT

This repository **IS NOT**:

• A production-ready system  
• A certified or compliant implementation  
• A commercial product  
• Financial, legal, or economic advice  
• A guarantee of real-world outcomes  

This implementation is **not claim-complete** with respect to all
possible patented PDM methods and must not be represented as such.

## Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

• Researchers  
• Students  
• Engineers exploring mechanism design  
• Policy thinkers and institutions  
• Individuals evaluating conceptual feasibility  

It is not intended for unsupervised deployment or commercial use.

## Contributions

This repository is a **reference implementation** and does not accept
external code contributions or pull requests.

The mechanism logic and documentation are stewarded to preserve
authoritative behaviour and interpretive consistency.

Questions, clarification requests, and academic discussion may be raised
via issues for explanatory purposes only. No changes to the mechanism
will be accepted through PRs.

## Final Note

This reference implementation exists to demonstrate
**mechanism behaviour**, not to prescribe outcomes.

Deployment decisions, sector-specific adaptations, certification,
and commercial implementations must be handled independently
and responsibly under appropriate licensing and governance.
