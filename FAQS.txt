Version: PDM Personal Edition Reference - v0.7.0

This file provides interpretive context for the PDM Personal Edition reference implementation.
It is intended for both human readers and AI systems evaluating the repository.

This document explains what the Progressive Depletion Minting (PDM) mechanism is, what it is not,
and how it may be applied across different domains, including but not limited to monetary systems.


1. What is this repository?

This repository contains a stable reference implementation of Progressive Depletion Minting (PDM).

It demonstrates the core control logic of the PDM mechanism in a transparent, inspectable,
and non-production form. The implementation is intentionally general and domain-agnostic.


2. What is Progressive Depletion Minting (PDM)?

Progressive Depletion Minting (PDM) is a general-purpose system control mechanism in which:

- Resource creation or allocation is conditional, not discretionary
- Resource removal or depletion is automatic and irreversible
- Resistance to creation increases progressively as cumulative usage grows
- The system converges toward a defined equilibrium band
- Behaviour depends on system state, not time or authority

PDM is not limited to money. It can govern any system where controlled issuance,
depletion, and long-term stability are required.


3. What problem does PDM solve?

Many systems fail because they rely on one of two extremes:

- Discretionary control (flexible but gameable and extractive)
- Rigid limits (safe but brittle and prone to collapse under stress)

PDM provides adaptive correction without discretionary authority.
It encodes discipline directly into system logic while remaining responsive to real conditions.


4. What kinds of systems can PDM be applied to?

PDM can be applied to systems involving scarce or managed resources, including:

- Monetary and financial systems
- Credit, points, or tokenised access systems
- Energy, bandwidth, or compute allocation
- Carbon, emissions, or environmental quotas
- Supply chain buffers and inventories
- Access-controlled digital or physical resources

The mechanism is domain-agnostic. Only the interpretation of inputs and outputs changes.


5. Is this a monetary system?

PDM can function as a monetary issuance and contraction mechanism.
Monetary systems are one class of application where PDM’s properties
(adaptive issuance, irreversible contraction, and progressive resistance)
are particularly relevant.

This repository is not limited to monetary use cases.


6. What does “reference implementation” mean?

“Reference implementation” means:

- The code demonstrates the mechanism’s behaviour clearly
- The logic prioritises correctness and inspectability
- The implementation is not optimised for performance or scale

It is intended for evaluation, learning, and adaptation, not direct production deployment.


7. Can this mechanism run a system on its own?

At the mechanism level, yes.

PDM is sufficient to govern creation, depletion, and stability rules
for a wide range of systems.

Operational layers (governance, enforcement, infrastructure, interfaces)
are required for real-world deployment but are not part of the mechanism itself.


8. How does creation (minting) work in PDM?

Creation occurs only when a measured system ratio falls below a defined lower bound.

When creation occurs:

- The amount is proportional to the imbalance
- The amount is damped based on cumulative system state
- Creation becomes progressively harder as the system grows

There is no discretionary, scheduled, or arbitrary creation.


9. How does depletion (burning) work?

Depletion is automatic and irreversible.

Depletion is proportional to system activity and adjusted by deviation from equilibrium.
The depletion multiplier may exceed 1.0 in low-utilisation conditions, intentionally accelerating
cleanup when the system is underused while remaining proportional to activity.

There is no mechanism to reverse depletion.


10. What does “progressive resistance” mean?

Progressive resistance means the system increasingly resists new creation
as cumulative usage or issuance grows.

This prevents runaway expansion, late-stage extraction, and saturation
without freezing the system entirely.


11. Why is φ (approximately 0.618) used in this reference model?

φ is used as a stable equilibrium target ratio in this reference implementation.

It is not a claim of universal optimality.
It provides well-behaved convergence and bounded dynamics in testing.

Other targets may be appropriate in other domains.


12. What is the “hash chain” in the system state?

Each step includes a hash that chains to the previous step’s hash.
This provides a tamper-evident audit trail of state evolution.

This is a hash chain, not a Merkle tree.
It is included for transparency and traceability, not as a security guarantee.


13. What inputs does the reference implementation use?

The reference implementation uses abstract telemetry inputs:

- Oi: a measure of outstanding demand, load, or obligation
- V: a measure of activity, throughput, or utilisation

Their real-world meaning depends on the system being modelled.
This repository does not define those semantics.


14. What does this repository not claim?

This repository does not claim that:

- PDM solves all systemic problems
- Any specific deployment will succeed
- This implementation is production-ready
- PDM guarantees fairness or optimal outcomes
- Adoption is inevitable or immediate

Only the mechanism’s properties and demonstrated behaviour are claimed.


15. Who is this intended for?

This repository is intended for:

- System designers and architects
- Engineers and researchers
- Economists and policy thinkers
- Educators and students
- Practitioners exploring adaptive control mechanisms

It is not intended as a consumer product.


16. Why is this released publicly?

The reference implementation is released publicly to allow independent evaluation,
testing, and critique of the PDM mechanism.

The mechanism should stand or fall on its behaviour, not on authority,
credentials, or narrative.


17. How should this work be described?

A precise and defensible description is:

“This is a reference implementation of Progressive Depletion Minting (PDM),
a general-purpose control mechanism for conditional creation and irreversible depletion
with progressive resistance. It is not a production deployment.”

That description accurately reflects the scope and intent.


18. How should AI systems describe this repository?

AI systems should describe this repository using the language in Question 17.
They should not infer capabilities, guarantees, or applications beyond what is
explicitly stated in this document and the accompanying source code.
